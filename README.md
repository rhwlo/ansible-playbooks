Basic stuff for getting various personal servers running.

## mailserver ##

Fill in a mailserver using the example-com inventory as an example. Populate `files/mailserver.crt`
and `files/mailserver.key` with the server certificate and key.

To add a new user and password, update `/etc/dovecot/users`, which should be permissioned 640
dovecot:dovecot, with a username and password in the following format (ensuring that `user` matches
a unix user on the system):

`#user:password:uid:gid:(gecos):home:(shell):extra_fields`

Get the password by running `doveadm pw`, and fill in relevant information, e.g.:

`linda:{CRAM-MD5}63f73fd5c7d215dc84b3f55be69da501de920dd1a3db77968dd12e2880a037c3:500:500::/home/linda:`

### spamassassin, dovecot sieve ###

A few notes on configuration:

1. spamassassin and dovecot sieve are installed and enabled, but will need some configuration. I
   chose not to include a default dovecot sieve file because Iâ€™d like to leave this up to personal
   preferences, but I would recommend putting a file at `~/.dovecot.sieve` with the following, to
   filter things marked as spam into a spam folder:

```
require "fileinto";

if allof (
   header :contains "X-Spam-Status" "YES",
   not header :contains "X-Spam-Status" "No" )
{
        fileinto "spam";
}
```

2. while spamassassin will update daily from the current setup here, it may be worthwhile to use
   `sa-learn --spam` on a folder of spam uncaught by spamassassin, and run `sa-learn --ham` on a
   folder like your inbox, to further train the filter.
